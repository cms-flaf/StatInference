"""The parts of the shape rebinning that do not care how many axes a histogram has.

Split out of bin_opt_2d/rebin_2d.py, which is where all of this was written and where
the comments' point of view comes from. It moved here unchanged so that anything else
that needs the *same* answers to the same questions -- what a slice has to contain to be
worth keeping, which processes are minor enough to exempt, which figure of merit decides
a boundary -- reads them from here, rather than from a second copy that would be a second
place for them to drift.

`_integral()` branches on GetDimension(), so everything downstream of it reads a TH1 and
a TH2 alike. What stays behind in the binner is the part that knows what a "bin" is: the
2D driver treats a slice as a directory of mass bins.

Nothing here is configuration. BINNING_DEFAULTS and load_binning_config() stay with the
binner, because their "unknown key raises" contract only works if the file that reads the
knobs states its own valid keys.
