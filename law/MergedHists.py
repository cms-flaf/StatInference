    External on purpose. The limit-setting chain consumes histograms it does not make, so
    a missing input is reported as a missing dependency rather than pulling the whole
    AnaTuple production graph (AnaTupleFileListTask -> HistFromNtupleProducerTask ->
    HistMergerTask) into the run and rebuilding its branch maps just to discover the file
    is already there.

    The path mirrors HistMergerTask.output() in FLAF/Analysis/tasks.py -- that is the
    contract between the two halves, and the only thing this chain needs from FLAF.
