    curve -- the standard single-curve plot with the +-1/+-2 sigma bands, which the overlay
    cannot show. External limits and luminosity projections are separate curves rather than
    datacards, so they appear only on the overlay.

    The finished plots are copied to fs_default alongside the rest of the chain's
    products; see DhiPlotMixin for how a dhi plot task is run and its output collected.
