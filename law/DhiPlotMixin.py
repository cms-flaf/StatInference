    """Running a dhi plot task from a StatInference task, and keeping what it drew.

    dhi writes its plots under inference/data/store, which is what makes an
    already-drawn plot cheap to re-request but leaves the products somewhere other than
    the rest of the chain's. Every task here follows the same three steps: work out where
    dhi will write, run it as a subprocess, copy the result into the task's own output.

    The dhi tasks are invoked as subprocesses rather than yielded as dynamic dependencies.
    luigi round-trips a dynamic dependency through to_str_params() / from_str_params(),
    and dhi declares parameters whose unset defaults do not survive that -- lumi_scale is
    a FloatParameter(default=None) that serialises to "None" and then raises on
    float("None"). Going through the command line keeps dhi unmodified.
