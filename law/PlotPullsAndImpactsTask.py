    fs_default beside the rest of the chain's products; dhi keeps its own copy under
    inference/data/store, which is what makes a redraw cheap.

        the limit is ~7 it is an almost invisible signal, so the ranking is really the
        background-only one, and where the limit is ~0.16 it is several times more signal
        than could be excluded, which pins r and collapses every impact towards zero.
        Ranking at the limit puts the fit where the measurement actually is.

        own parameter description says as much ("they might not be encoded into output
        file paths"). So changing poi_value or fit_args and re-running under the same
        version silently reuses the previous fits, and --redraw then redraws from those.
